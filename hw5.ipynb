        "The GCF of negative numbers is the same as the GCF of their positive numbers. I have converted the numbers into positive ones using the absolute “abs()” function. We need to find the greatest and smallest of two numbers given as input so that we can divide the greatest number by the smallest number. \n",
        "Then I checked if one of the numbers is equal to zero. If one of the numbers is equal to zero The GCF is going to be the other number. Then we calculate the remainder of two numbers and see if it is zero. If the remainder is zero, the divisor is going to be returned as the GCF else we call the same function again using the divisor and remainder which are the new numbers given as the parameters to the function. We repeat the same process till the GCF is calculated.<br>\n",
